# SolarSteps

SYN 100 Project

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Social media and doom scrolling have led to passive content consumption instead of meaningful engagement. The lack of offline communities weakens our ability to take real-world action. Many people want to be sustainable but donâ€™t know how to start.

GOAL : Influence sustainable actions in order to build habits for individuals and create a community within our app to influence the solarpunk ideology. Accomplish this by creating an app that follows a task based system, allowing users to complete real-life tasks tied to sustainable actions for in-app rewards. 

AUDIENCE: College students, specifically for students in the Synthesis program, to put into practice the things discussed in class. Hopefully, spread to a more widespread audience, but specifically Gen Z, and those being directly involved in the climate crisis.
