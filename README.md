# SolarSteps

SYN 100 Project

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Social media and doom scrolling have led to passive content consumption instead of meaningful engagement. The lack of online communities that make real-world positive actions is a problem because it limits the potential for meaningful change, reinforcing passive engagement instead of inspiring tangible impact in local and global communities.  Many people want to be sustainable and follow the SolarPunk lifestyle but donâ€™t know how to start.

GOAL : Influence sustainable actions in order to build habits for individuals and create a community within our app to influence the solarpunk ideology. Accomplish this by creating an app that follows a task based system, allowing users to complete real-life tasks tied to sustainable actions for in-app rewards. 

AUDIENCE: College students, specifically for students in the Synthesis program, to put into practice the things discussed in class. Hopefully, spread to a more widespread audience, but specifically Gen Z, and those being directly involved in the climate crisis.
